"""The vjepa-core model: stroke regression from frozen V-JEPA 2.1 latents.

Mask net over the latent grid (taken from the cache shape) -> per-head
attention pooling of the latents -> dilated TCN trunk -> the heads.
Motion, including stroke direction, must come out of the frozen
features. Windows run straight across cuts with a per-row cut-flag
channel at the TCN input -- the model learns what a seam means; no
footage is discarded. Unscripted script gaps supervise nothing: their
interpolated targets say "hold still" regardless of the screen, the
deploy-domain lesson backwards.

The trunk recipe is fixed (recipes/*.json name the few knobs that
remain): the envelope-cotrained gap-masked trunk with the phase-cap
objective (per step, a supervised row whose softmax puts below-chance
mass on the +-2-bin neighborhood of its target leaves every phase-side
loss -- self-releasing, no labels, no sidecars), phase-only R-Drop
(level head excluded), and coordinate channels into the mask net with
per-head gate mass and attention centroid to the TCN input. The heads:

  * marginal velocity -- 41-bin CE, expectation decode; sole owner of
    PHASE (reversal timing). Phase supervision stays strict everywhere.
  * position level -- CE over the ~2 s-smoothed script position,
    class-balanced. Velocity cannot represent level (holds at the top
    and at mid-stroke are both zero velocity), but V-JEPA latents see
    pose -- the head anchors level-aware styling (jepa_infer) so drafts
    stop returning to the center during extremes and holds.
  * generative envelope -- an autoregressive head over the cycle-scale
    AMPLITUDE envelope, the axis where one-to-many authorship ambiguity
    lives. At decode the marginal signal is normalized to a phase
    carrier and rescaled by the generated envelope: zero crossings
    never move, amplitude commits. Its aux supervision also helps the
    trunk.
  * deploy refit (jepa_refit.py) -- AFTER training, the band-extent
    rails, the stillness envelope (the SHIPPING amplitude head -- the
    co-trained aux envelope above only shapes the trunk), the
    trapezoid-dwell head and the reversal-event head are refit on the
    run's own frozen best checkpoint and grafted in. The trunk
    trajectory is over before the refit starts, so the attention gate
    is the trained checkpoint's by construction (training the rails or
    the dwell head alongside the trunk measurably costs gate quality).
    Every deploy head lives here for that reason: they are decode-time
    signals, and the trunk pays for carrying them.

Checkpoint selection: mean 0-anchor val corr over per-clip held-out
segments (common.val_regions -- the ONE val definition every scorer
shares), always on the MARGINAL decode. Per-clip verdicts come from
the eval command's read tables.
