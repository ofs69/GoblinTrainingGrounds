"""Frozen video encoders behind one interface.

Extraction only ever needs four things from an encoder: the input resolution it
wants, the spatial grid and token dim it emits, and a forward that turns a window
of decoded frames into raw tokens. Everything downstream of the PCA basis is
128-dim int8 regardless, so the encoder's own dim never propagates past extraction.

Two families, and they do NOT share an API:

* ``hf``  -- V-JEPA 2 via ``transformers`` (the incumbent). Takes (B,T,C,H,W),
  returns ``.last_hidden_state``.
* ``hub`` -- V-JEPA 2.1 via ``torch.hub`` on facebookresearch/vjepa2. There is no
  transformers support and no HF checkpoint for the 2.1 line. The hub entrypoints
  take (B,C,T,H,W) and hand back ``(encoder, predictor)``; we keep the encoder.

Both flatten tokens temporal-major (t, gy, gx) -> ``reshape(-1, grid, grid, dim)``
is valid for either.

Only encoders at or below the incumbent's size are exposed: the encoder is paid once
per clip at extraction AND again on every user video at deploy, so a larger trunk is
permanently more expensive. The 2.1 ViT-g (1B) / ViT-G (2B) tiers are out of scope.

# name -> (kind, identifier, input resolution, patch size, scope, layer)
#
# ``scope`` namespaces every filesystem artifact an extraction writes (cache
# dirs ``<scope>_pca<dim>cut*``, basis ``<scope>/pca_basis*.npz``, tokstats
# ``<scope>/tokstats*/``), so encoders coexist in ONE tree sharing videos/
# meta/scripts/boundaries. The incumbent's scope is the legacy "vjepa", so
# every existing dataset_v2 path is byte-identical to before scoping existed.
#
# The shipped 2.1 ViT-B is ``vjepa2_1_vitb_dist_vitG_384``: a DISTILLATION of the
# ViT-G (its predictor projects into 1664 channels, the teacher's width), and that
# recipe is not among the released configs. So the resolution it was trained at is
# not recoverable from configs/train_2_1/vitb16 -- those describe a from-scratch
# ViT-B that is not this one -- nor from the weights, which carry no ``pos_embed``
# at all because position is RoPE. What the checkpoint does say is ``384``, in its
# name and its hub entrypoint. 256px is the cheaper read and yields a 16x16 grid,
# 384px the model's own label and a 24x24 one; both are legitimate and which is
# BETTER is an open question (D4).
#
# ``layer`` is a BLOCK INDEX into the encoder's hierarchical tap set
# (None = the final output). The 2.1 ViTs expose taps at
# ``hierarchical_layers`` -- [2, 5, 8, 11] at depth 12 -- each through a
# per-tap LayerNorm (``norms_block``); the "final output" is itself just
# the last tap (block 11 + ``norms_block[-1]``). In the shipped ViT-B
# checkpoint only that FINAL norm carries a trained affine; the
# intermediate norms are affine-at-init to the bit, so an intermediate tap
# = plain normalized block output -- well-conditioned, and the whitened PCA
# basis (fit on the tapped tokens) absorbs any affine regardless. Those
# untouched affines also say that no loss ever reached blocks 2/5/8 in this
# student: whatever deep supervision the 2.1 PRETRAINING line applies, the
# distilled ViT-B was fit at its output alone. Rationale for tapping below
# the top: the last layer is shaped for the predictor/distillation
# interface (semantic, context-heavy) while stroke phase is low-level
# motion, which mid-depth carries more of. Hub family
# only; the tap is selected by setting ``model.out_layers`` (the forward
# then returns the normed tap; token stream stays pure patches, so the
# grid reshape contract is unchanged).
